# Weather Prediction and Alert System Using Decision Tree

This project implements a simple weather prediction and alert system using a decision tree classifier. It predicts the weather based on precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed.

## Introduction

This system provides a user-friendly interface to input weather parameters and predict the weather condition using a decision tree classifier model. Additionally, it provides alerts for extreme weather conditions such as cyclones, floods, heavy snowfall, and droughts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Geocoder
- Tkinter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aiswarya-Menon/WeatherPrediction-DecisionTree.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
 ```bash
 pip install pandas scikit-learn geocoder
```
3.Run the application:
 ```bash
python weather_prediction.py

```
